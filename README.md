<h1 align="center">Base Apparel Coming Soon Page</h1>

<br>
<br>

## About The Project

<p>This layout looks simple enough, but there are some interesting details to it that will test your CSS skills. You'll also get to practice basic form validation.
The challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
<br><br>Users should be able to:
<br>1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
<br>
3. Receive an error message when the form is submitted if the input field is empty & the email address is not formatted correctly.

<br>
<br> <p>I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.</p>




## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- JavaScript

## What I learned

My second project where I used some email validation process. Another quick project to practice some JavaScript and CSS. Nothing new that I learned however decreased the timing to do the projects in general. Used to take much longer.


## Useful resources

1. <a /">Figma</a> - Paste your design image to check the size of containers, width, etc.
2. <a ">Perfect Pixel</a> - Awesome Chrome extension that helps you to match the pixels of the provided design.
